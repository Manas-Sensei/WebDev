# My Programming Practice Projects  Welcome to my collection of entry-level programming projects. This repository showcases my journey as I learn the fundamentals of Python and front-end web development using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  ## About  - **Python:**     Contains scripts and small programs focused on logic building, problem-solving, and core programming concepts.  - **HTML, CSS, JavaScript:**     Includes practice projects for building and styling web pages, as well as implementing basic interactivity and dynamic features.  These projects are independent and are organized for easy navigation and continued growth as I expand my skills.  ## Getting Started  - To view web projects, open the HTML files in your browser. - To run Python scripts, open them in a Python environment and execute as standalone files.  ## Goals  - Strengthen understanding of Python fundamentals. - Gain hands-on experience in creating and designing web pages. - Learn the basics of user interaction with JavaScript.  This repository will be updated regularly as I progress in my learning journey.
